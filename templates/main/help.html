    <h1>Help for New POD/Data Center</h1>
    <p> Antigua help information</p>
    <h3>This is what you are building</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/dc.jpg') }}" width="1020" />
    <p>
    <h3> Assumptions </h3>
    <p> The wiring of the spine/leaf architecture follows a standard deploymet. All spine01 connections
        go to port 1 of the leaf(s). Then the next spine (spine02), will have its interfaces connected to
        port 2 of all leaves and so on until the fabric is complete.</p>

    <p>The names of the Arista Configlets follows the format of (POD name).(switch_role). EX. pod2.spine01
      The hostnames, on the devices themselves, the host name MUST match the configlet name. EX pod2.spine01.
      ANY CHANGE TO THIS WILL CAUSE THIS APPLICATION TO FAIL!!!!!!<p>


      <p>Antigua is a mongo database used for managing variables for spine/leaf networks.
      The fields in the database hold the minimal variables needed to spawn all the information needed be managed by ansible.
      After performing the <b>Zero Thouch</b> operation, the switches will be ready for ansible-playbooks.<br><hr>

      Using a zero touch provisioning <b>techops</b> process with a Linux host configured with DHCP option 67 truly provides for no touch (of the switch!).<br><hr>

      Arista switches load a python file and execute it locally and create the basic configuration
      necessary for Ansible management.<br>

      Once the ZTP process has ran, the switches are ready to be added to the Cloud Vision Portal server or be managed by the playbooks used with this program.<br><hr>

      <b>Current Behavior</b><br>

      This application uses "SEED" variables. You enter the seed management IP address and the system will generate
      all the IP addresses required for the management interfaces. Same with loopback addresses and Router Id's.

      At this release the primary fileds are as follows.<br><hr>

      <b>POD</b>
      <p> The name of the POD. Used to track different data center installations. (POD1, DC2-POD2, etc)</p><br>

      <b>Management IP</b>
      <p> Seed IP for all of the management addresses assigne to the OOB management port </p><br>

      <b>Networks/Fabric</b>
      <p> The seed address used to populate the L3/Fabric connections between switches </p><br>

      <b>Router ID</b>
      <p> Seed address for router id's  </p><br>

      <b>Gateway</b>
      <p> The default gateway for the O.O.B. management network</p><br>

      <b>Loopbacks</b>
      <p> The seed IP for the switch loopback addresses</p><br>

      <b>SSH User</b>
      <p> Name of the management user. Like "admin" </p><br>

      <b>SSH Password</b>
      <p> Password of the SSH User </p><br>

      <b>Spines</b>
      <p> Dropdown for the total number of spines </p><br>

      <b>Leafs</b>
      <p> Dropdown for the total number of leafs </p><br>
